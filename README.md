This is a simple website for cafes or Restaurants. We can update the cafe in the database, it will display all the details in menu with Google Maps. This website will be convenient to locate your restaurant in your town.

Project Description

This project is a web application for managing a cafe's data, potentially including operations like displaying menu items, taking orders, and managing inventory. The main components of the project include:

Data Management: The cafe-data.csv file likely contains data related to the cafe, such as menu items, prices, and inventory details.

Web Application: The main.py file serves as the main script for the web application, built using the Flask framework. This script is responsible for setting up the web server, handling routes, and rendering templates.

Dependencies: 

The requirements.txt file lists the necessary dependencies for the project, ensuring that all required libraries and frameworks are installed. These dependencies include:

Bootstrap_Flask: Integration of Bootstrap with Flask for styling and responsive design.
Flask: The web framework used to create the web application.
WTForms and Flask_WTF: Used for form handling and validation.
Werkzeug: A WSGI utility library used by Flask for request and response handling.
Detailed Breakdown
1. cafe-data.csv
This CSV file is expected to hold structured data related to the cafe's operations. Typical columns might include:

Item Name: The name of the menu item.
Category: The item category (e.g., beverage, snack).
Price: The price of the item.
Stock: Quantity available in inventory.
2. main.py
This script is the heart of the web application. It will typically include:

Route Definitions: Functions that define the endpoints (URLs) of the application and the logic associated with each endpoint.
Template Rendering: Code to render HTML templates, displaying dynamic content based on data from the CSV file.
Form Handling: Logic to handle user input through forms, possibly for adding new items to the menu or updating existing items.
3. requirements.txt
This file ensures that the environment has all the necessary libraries installed. The listed libraries help in creating a robust, user-friendly web application:

Bootstrap_Flask: Provides Bootstrap integration for responsive design.
Flask: The core web framework.
WTForms and Flask_WTF: Simplify form creation and validation.
Werkzeug: Supports request handling and other utilities.
Potential Features
Given the components, the project could potentially include features like:

Menu Display: Showing the cafe's menu to users.
Order Management: Allowing users to place orders through the web interface.
Inventory Management: Tracking stock levels and alerting when items are low.
Form Validation: Ensuring that input data is correctly formatted and valid.
Next Steps
